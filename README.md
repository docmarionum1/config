# Dvorak + QWERTY Modifier AutoHotkey Scripts

This repo contains [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts for using Dvorak with Windows
but using QWERTY when pressing a modifier key (ctrl, alt, windows).

There are two flavors: One for when you're using Dvorak as your base keyboard layout and
then other when you're using QWERTY.

- `dvorak-ctrl-qwerty.ahk` is for when using the Dvorak layout. Press `Win+Space` to toggle between
QWERTY and Dvorak.
- `qwerty-dvorak.ahk` is for when you're using a qwerty layout. Press `Scroll Lock` to toggle
between QWERTY and Dvorak.

They're functionally the same in most cases, but I found that the second one doesn't play nicely
with one time passwords from security keys, since the characters get mapped into Dvorak as well.
So the first one, `dvorak-ctrl-qwerty.ahk`, is newer and preferred.


## Installation

- Download this repo
- Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
